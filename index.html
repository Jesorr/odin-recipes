    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>We eat a lot of bananas at our house. Every time we go to the grocery store (maybe twice a month),
            we buy about a dozen bananas. For some that may not sound like much, but there's only three 
            of us, and one is a toddler. We eat a lot of bananas, but a vast majority end up getting frozen
            and eaten later. They typically turn into fruit smoothies, but <em>every now and then</em>,
            they turn into banana bread. </p>
        <p>Now we generally eat pretty healthy. We tend to eat sweets in moderation if at all, but 
            to be quite honest, all restraint and self discipline goes out the window when we have 
            banana bread at home. It's sweet, but not too sweet. It's nice and soft, but can have just
            the right amount of crunch with a few nuts. Warm this bad boy up and spread a little butter
            and you have heaven on a plate. Anywho, here it is!</p>
