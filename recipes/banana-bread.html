        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>We eat a lot of bananas at our house. Every time we go to the grocery store (maybe twice a month),
                we buy about a dozen bananas. For some that may not sound like much, but there's only three 
                of us, and one is a toddler. We eat a lot of bananas, but a vast majority end up getting frozen
                and eaten later. They typically turn into fruit smoothies, but <em>every now and then</em>,
                they turn into banana bread. </p>
            <p>Now we generally eat pretty healthy. We tend to eat sweets in moderation if at all, but 
                to be quite honest, all restraint and self discipline goes out the window when we have 
                banana bread at home. It's sweet, but not too sweet. It's nice and soft, but can have just
                the right amount of crunch with a few nuts. Warm this bad boy up and spread a little butter
                and you have heaven on a plate. Anywho, here it is!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 medium, peeled, very ripe bananas</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Preheat oven and prepare pan</h4>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Mash bananas and add butter</h4>
                <p>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. 
                    Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Mix in remaining ingredients</h4>
                <p>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract.
                     Mix in the flour.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Bake</h4>
                <p>Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer 
                    inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of 
                    wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still 
                    wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully 
                    baked.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Cool and serve</h4>
                <p>emove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana 
                bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve.</p></li>
